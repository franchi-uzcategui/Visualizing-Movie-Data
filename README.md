# Visualizing-Movie-Data

A new movie production company wants to make a new movie. Therefore, there is the need to deepen the movie trends within three specific areas:

Time period: How have movie genres changed over time?
Movie company: How do the attributes differ between Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures?
Movie performance:  How have movies based on novels performed relative to movies not based on novels?

Tool used: Tableau.
